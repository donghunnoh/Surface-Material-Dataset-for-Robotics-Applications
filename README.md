# Surface-Material-Dataset-for-Robotics-Applications (SMDRA): A Dataset with Friction Coefficient and RGB-D for Surface Segmentation

**Overview**  
Welcome to the official repository for the "Surface Material Dataset for Robotics Applications (SMDRA)". This dataset is a comprehensive collection of surface material data, specifically designed to advance research and applications in the field of robotics. Our dataset is unique in that it includes both friction coefficient measurements and RGB-D (color and depth) data for surface segmentation, providing a rich resource for researchers and practitioners in robotics and related fields.

**Dataset Description**  
The SMDRA dataset is meticulously curated to address the critical need for detailed surface material information in robotic applications. It includes:

- Friction Coefficient Data: Precise measurements of friction coefficients for a variety of surface materials, offering valuable insights for tasks requiring tactile interaction, such as gripping and maneuvering.

- RGB-D Data: High-quality RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and Depth information for each surface material, enabling advanced surface segmentation and material recognition tasks.

This dataset is particularly useful for researchers focusing on robotic manipulation, autonomous navigation, and machine learning models that require an understanding of surface properties.

**Applications**  
The SMDRA dataset is designed to be a versatile tool for a wide range of robotics applications, including but not limited to:

- Robotic Manipulation: Enhancing the capability of robotic systems in accurately identifying and interacting with various surfaces.

- Autonomous Navigation: Assisting in the development of navigation algorithms that can adapt to different terrain types based on surface characteristics.

- Machine Learning and Computer Vision: Providing a rich dataset for training and testing algorithms in surface material recognition and segmentation.

**Accessing the Dataset**  
The dataset can be found in the 'SMDRA' folder within this repository.

**OnGoing Research**  
The paper 'Surface-Material-Dataset-for-Robotics-Applications (SMDRA): A Dataset with Friction Coefficient and RGB-D for Surface Segmentation' was primarily aimed at highlighting the importance of friction coefficient data and illustrating the process of its collection. Additionally, it served as an initial effort to demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset we created. As a next step, we are currently conducting research that utilizes this dataset to estimate the friction coefficients of unknown surface materials.
